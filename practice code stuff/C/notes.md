# C notes

- On a later date, this will also contain a little excalidraw file with some flowcharts if i remember to complete that one!!!

## What is C?

- C is a programming language that was made to make coding apps and libraries easy... Or that's all you need to know rn anyways!

## Basic Syntax:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>

int main(){
    printf("Hello world!!!");
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. `#include < ... >`: This is the section which is used for defining libraries to be used in the program. The main one is `stdio.h`.
2. `int main()`: The main class is defined like this. Anything inside `main()` will be executed in the program.
3. `{ ... }`: These are used to write the actual code. Anything inside `{}` will be treated as code. Anything else is invalid (depending on the context of the file.)
4. `printf( ... );`: This function is used to print something to the console as an output.
